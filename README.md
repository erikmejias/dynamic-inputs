# Experiment with dynamic pills within inputs

This is a sandbox to experiment with dynamic pills within inputs, the idea behind it is to copy the same behaviour Webflow has with their CMS fields within input fields on Dynamic Pages. I'll be using this on a Webflow designer app for a client.

See a demo on how it works on /docs/recording.mov
